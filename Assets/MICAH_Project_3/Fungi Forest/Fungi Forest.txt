Fantasy inspired lowpoly/retro forest assets with variations of each.

This pack will provide you with woodland assets to help you get started on creating retro inspired zones.

I will be creating more packs to add onto this in the future, focusing on specific biomes.
If you use this pack, be sure to tell me what you think, so I can improve this pack and future creations.
