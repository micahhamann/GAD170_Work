        * Write some code to do the following:
        * Create a local variable to hold a random float, between 1 and 10, leave a comment for its purpose.          
        * Debug log the value of the number
        * Check for and Debug out the following:
            * Debug log "The number was exactly one" if randomNumber equals 1.
            * Debug log "The number was greater than three" if randomNumber is greater than 3.
            * Debug log 'The number was greater than 7 or less than 5' if randomNumber is greater than 7 or less than 5; otherwise, debug log 'the number was 6 or 7'."
            * Debug log "The number was greater than one and less than 5; or the number was greater than 5" if randomNumber is greater than 1 and less than 5, or if it's greater than 5.
        * Bonus - Let’s debug out a percentage of the result, i.e. if the max possible random number is 10 and our random number is 1, as a percentage should be ?
